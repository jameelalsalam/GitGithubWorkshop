# Collaboration / Workflow Exercises

Git and Github are powerful tools that can be used in different ways depending on the preferences of the team. The steps here will demonstrate two approaches.

- [ ] Single repo, multiple contributors (good for small teams)
- [ ] Fork and pull request workflow (Github flow, good for open source)


## Small Team Workflow

For this workflow, you use a single repo on Github or Bitbucket and have multiple contributors with write permissions. This can be done with either a private or public repo, and  

1. Make a repo (on Github)
2. Add your neighbor as a contributor (on Github)
3. Both of you follow the pull-edit-commit-push workflow
4. Occassionally you will get a merge conflict!

Add more -- dealing with merge conflicts.

TODO: add detailed steps to add neighbor as contributor and try this out.


## Fork and Pull Request

When you are working on an open source project, you may receive contributions from people outside of your organization who you have never met or spoken to offline. They don't have edit permissions on your repo, so how do they contribute improvements to your code?

Outside collaborator takes following steps:

1. Forks a copy of the repo to their own account
2. Clones the fork to their local machine
3. Make a new branch with proposed edits
4. Push edits/new branch back to their Github account
5. Open a pull request to the original upstream repository

Then the original repository owner:

6. Inspects the proposed changes
7. Merges the proposed changes into the main repo (or request changes, or discuss, or reject the request)
